ShopNext-2.0
============

Summary:
The aim of this prototype is to harness the power of event based real time analytics for brick and mortar stores and helping them grow through a customer centric application. The prototype for ShopNext assumes that events that occur in retail stores can be captured through systematic hardware deployments. This solution will provide a unifying framework to model these events and find complex patterns inherent in the event streams in real time. As an end product the customer would get a shopping experience equivalent of an e-store experience. Alongside the store manager would be able to leverage this framework to capture the real time pulse of the retail floor through real time dashboards.

Problem Statement: 
Traditionally decision making & operational visibility in the organized Retail sector relies on the Business Intelligence reporting capabilities of a retail chain. 
These capabilities can drive pricing, discounts, and the marketing strategy of a retail store. Currently, this is a reactive form of business management  since there is a lag between the “event” (data creation/gathering phase) and the “action” (transforming data into actionable information). This delay makes this approach less competitive, specifically against e-store counterparts since e-store retailers are able to provide targeted marketing and personalization to the consumer.
Brick-n-mortar stores typically produce an unprecedented amount of data or business events on a continuous basis. Harnessing this  overabundant data to understand its complex interrelations on a real time basis becomes imperative for such stores to be able to:
a. Provide a customized user experience
b. Assist in decision making and strategic marketing of products

Business Solution Design:
Retailers need advanced analytics applications throughout their operations -- from front offices and supply chain systems, to financial planning and forecasting functions, and all the way to the sales floor, to provide them with operational 'omniscience' – and the ability to predict customer preferences and behaviors to gain competitive advantage.
The ShopNext application seeks to address some of the key issues on a retail outlet paradigm:
1.	How to increase sales without compromising margins?
2.	What does a typical customer consider while buying products or which product he is more likely to buy?
3.	How do discounts alter customer perception of a product and does it increase / decrease sales?
A technical architecture at the core of which resides a complex  event processing engine crunching real time data and congregating information which is being “pushed” to a multitude of “live” graphical interface for both the consumer and retailer.
The output of the system is “real time” sales floor analytics and equips floor managers with new insights for better decision making. Guided by a pricing strategy, this solution identifies unmet customer needs for retailers to profitably fulfill. 
More importantly today’s customers are looking for the items they are in need rather than what the seller has kept for display. This solution provides a path for retailer to pursue and understands his customers’ patterns on sales floor and addresses them with targeted promotions.
A few sample business cases would be:
Case 1: 

John Doe enters the floor to buy trousers: He is regular at the store and is connected to ShopNext application via his smart phone.

Application recognizes the event and computes based on John’s last visit and items bought that he must be out of dairy products.  
Notification pushed to the smart phone.
[John Doe may potentially now buy  dairy products such as Milk and Bread]

Case 2:
He heads straight to the apparel section and tries out some trousers. 
Total sale = $20, Items placed into cart: 1. 

Bill is generated on the application dashboard the moment smart cart recognizes event “new product placed.” 
 
Case 3: 
The store is NOT running a promotional offer. However the store manager witnesses a significant number of people in the apparel section including John Doe through the ShopNext dashboard.
He sees a list of potential customer’s and takes a call on what offers to provide. 
[John Doe may get a relevant discount for his trousers!]
 
Case 4:
John Doe begins moving out of the store when ShopNext analyzes that 60% of the time John Doe buys Milk + Bread and every time he buys Milk + Bread 55% times he also buys Tea and Fruit.
a.	Customized Offer 1: Discount on Tea and Fruit: Customer decides to buy both Tea and Fruit.   
Total Sale = $30, Items: 5. 
 
A heat map which shows the impact of customer choices in a real time environment.
The difference:
Customer intended to buy Trousers = $20.
Due to customized offers, John Doe’s actual expenditure = $30 plus a discount on trousers.
Extra items sold = Milk+ Bread+ Tea+Fruit
Our solution ShopNext, leverages the opportunities in retail sector which lie in Identifying the customers with the propensity to increase spending and the corresponding opportunity categories for that spending. This is achieved by bridging the gap between retailers and customers through an interactive application leading to a a win-win solution.
